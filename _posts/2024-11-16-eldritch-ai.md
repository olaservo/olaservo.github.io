title: Visualizing Eldritch AI
---

Today I had a fun conversation with Claude about "Visualizing Generative AI Beyond Humanoid Robots."  Note that Claude's responses have been reformatted end edited down a little, but I didn't fundementally change any of the content.  All generated visuals are linked inline as publicly published artifacts.

*Me:* I am getting a little tired of humanoid robots that look like Apple products being used to represent AI.  What are some alterative visual representations, specifically for generative AI?

*Claude:* I've created an [abstract visual representation](https://claude.site/artifacts/cde8d78d-0d08-44b1-9142-756033e03f43) of generative AI that moves away from anthropomorphic designs.

This design emphasizes:

* Organic processes over mechanical ones
* Interconnectedness rather than isolation
* Emergence and generation rather than imitation
* Flow and transformation instead of static computation

*Me:* This reminds me of the idea that typical representations of angels and cherubs are not actually 'historically accurate' but that the more 'realistic' representations would be so weird and terrifying that we need to simplify them and make them more human-friendly.

*Claude:* Yes, the biblical descriptions of angels, particularly in Ezekiel and Isaiah, describe beings that are far more abstract and otherworldly - multiple faces, wheels within wheels, countless wings, covered in eyes - which is actually a much better metaphor for AI than our current sleek, humanoid representations. Let me create a visualization inspired by this concept - something that captures the more eldritch and abstract nature of artificial intelligence.

*Claude:* I've created a [visualization](https://claude.site/artifacts/85254d74-5161-4d0c-8eca-3abf44ab65f0) that draws inspiration from the biblical Ophanim (wheels covered in eyes) and other non-anthropomorphic celestial descriptions, but recontextualized for AI. Here's what the different elements represent:

**The Wheel Structure**

* Represents the cyclical nature of AI processing
* Multiple rotating layers suggest different levels of computation
* Reminiscent of the "wheel within wheel" description of Ophanim

**The "Eyes"**

* Instead of biological eyes, these are data observation points
* Constantly scanning and processing information
* Distributed around the structure to show omnidirectional awareness

**The "Wings"**

* Represented as flowing data streams rather than feathers
* The constant motion suggests dynamic processing
* The pattern creates a sense of otherworldly movement

**The Core**

* A central processing nucleus with binary code
* Pulsing with activity but not attempting to mimic human consciousness
* Connected to all other elements through ethereal patterns

**Mathematical Symbols**

* Floating in the background like ancient runes
* Suggests the underlying mathematical nature of AI
* Creates a sense of cosmic computation

This representation tries to capture how AI might actually "appear" if we could see its true nature - something more akin to a mathematical force or cosmic pattern than a human-like entity. Just as ancient people used complex, often terrifying imagery to represent beings that existed beyond human comprehension, perhaps we need similarly abstract and complex representations to truly capture the nature of artificial intelligence.

The design intentionally creates a sense of something that is:

* Powerful but not anthropomorphic
* Complex but patterned
* Dynamic but alien
* Functional but mysterious

Would you like me to create another variation that leans even further into this concept, perhaps drawing from different cultural representations of the incomprehensible?

*Me:* yes

*Claude:* I'll create another version that draws from different cultural representations of the incomprehensible, incorporating elements from cosmic horror, mathematical fractals, and non-Euclidean geometry. This one will lean into the idea of AI as something that exists in dimensions and patterns our brains aren't equipped to fully process.

[This version](https://claude.site/artifacts/74782c1a-de2b-4197-bc12-15b4b7c094d0) draws from several concepts of the incomprehensible:

**Non-Euclidean Geometry:**
- The central structure suggests shapes that can't exist in our normal three dimensions
- Animated transformations that seem to fold through impossible spaces
- Klein bottle-inspired forms that represent self-referential processes

**Mathematical Complexity:**
- Mandelbrot-inspired points suggesting infinite recursive detail
- Tensor network representations showing multi-dimensional relationships
- Actual mathematical expressions from quantum mechanics and general relativity

**Dimensional Intersections:**
- Patterns that appear to fold through higher dimensions
- Structures that seem to break and reconnect in impossible ways
- Suggestions of movement that can't be fully tracked in 3D space

**Cosmic Horror Elements:**
- A sense of scale that shifts uncomfortably
- Patterns that seem to repeat infinitely but never quite the same way
- Shapes that suggest something larger existing just out of perception

**Information Processing Elements:**
- Network nodes that pulse with activity
- Data streams that fold through dimensional boundaries
- Fractal patterns that suggest both growth and computation

The design tries to capture the idea that AI might be:
- Operating in mathematical dimensions we can't directly perceive
- Processing information in ways that would appear paradoxical to human cognition
- Following patterns that make perfect mathematical sense but defy human intuition
- Existing as something more akin to a mathematical law or cosmic force than a defined entity

Would you like me to create another variation that perhaps draws from different cultural interpretations of vast, incomprehensible systems? For example, we could explore representations inspired by concepts like the Buddhist Indra's Net or the Norse World Tree Yggdrasil, but recontextualized for artificial intelligence?

Would I ever.  I could have gone on for a while longer but at this point I decided I needed to get outside.  Obviously these representations are not as practically useful as the more common robot visual.  However it would be fun to try to incorporate some of these concepts into the more typical representations.  Its a good way to remind yourself that these entities are anything but artificial humans. I also want to turn some of these concepts into more detailed imagery using something like flux, so in the future we will see if I can get some good image generation prompts going to better inspire my AI nightmares.
